/subtitle() Launching /x

/section
The program is launched using the command: /bold() dotnet run [input file] [setup file] /x

/section
The input file is a required argument, but the setup file is optional. If it is not provided, it defaults to the global Setup.json.

/section
For the program to work correctly, in addition to the standard .NET distribution, you must install the /bold() iText /x package version 9.1.0 or higher and /bold itext7.bouncy-castle-adapter /x version 9.1.0 or higher. Both packages should install automatically when launching the program using the command shown above.

/section
Note: If issues with the packages still occur, they can be installed manually using the command /bold dotnet add package /x followed by the package name.

/subtitle() Controls /x

/section 
The program has no additional interactive controls. The user can influence its behavior through the two input parameters when running it.
Another option for personalization lies in the second parameter, as the user can create their own custom CzeTex text functions and use them in the input file.

/section
For more detailed information about writing input files in CzeTex syntax, see the documentation section on /bold usage examples /xd

/bold() Recommendation: Setup files must follow a precise structure and contain valid references to internal functions. Therefore, when creating a personalized setup file, it is recommended to start with a copy of the global setup file and only modify the keywords according to your preferences. /x
